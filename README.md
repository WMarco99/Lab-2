For this map, I created a transit stop map where all bus stops and train stations could be searched up by train. This map is intended for general public for navigation. I used previous labs to as a reference for the lab. In terms of data, I sourced the stop data from Github (link: https://github.com/carsonyl/translink-derived-datasets). The markers are chosen to be grey to fit the map as there is an overwhelming amount of stops that would be too harsh on the eyes. When highlighted, the stop will turn blue for easy navigation. In terms of interactivity, labels will appear over the stop to provide information for the user.
In terms of critique, I did not recieved any critiques so I used my own intuition to improve my map as I saw fit. Due to technical difficulties and lack of time, I was only able to provide a search bar to highlight stops. If I were to further develop the map, I would have added a draw function to create markers in the map. Furthermore, I would use that function to detect the closest stop to that marker.
